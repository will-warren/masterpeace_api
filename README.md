# masterpeace api

A reboot of my final project from The Iron Yard Python intensive course. Masterpeace is a social network for creatives.

This is an API endpoint and will serve as a way to build front ends in various JS frameworks and to learn to better use the framework of choice.

Built using:

* Flask
* Flask API
* SQLAlchemy
* Postgresql on an AWS RDS
